### Instrumenting Java Spring Boot Application for Azure Monitor using OpenTelemetry and Deploying to AKS:

#### 1. Prerequisites:

- A Java Spring Boot application.
- AKS (Azure Kubernetes Service) cluster set up.
- Azure CLI or Kubernetes CLI (`kubectl`).

#### 2. Set Up OpenTelemetry Collector:

Azure Monitor doesn't support OTLP (OpenTelemetry Line Protocol) directly. Thus, you'll need the OpenTelemetry Collector to convert OTLP to a format supported by Azure Monitor.

- **Create a ConfigMap** for the OpenTelemetry Collector with configurations for OTLP receivers and the Azure Monitor exporter.

  ```yaml
  # otel-collector-config.yaml
  receivers:
    otlp:
      protocols:
        grpc:

  exporters:
    azuremonitor:
      instrumentation_key: YOUR_INSTRUMENTATION_KEY

  service:
    pipelines:
      traces:
        receivers: [otlp]
        exporters: [azuremonitor]
      metrics:
        receivers: [otlp]
        exporters: [azuremonitor]
  ```

- Deploy the OpenTelemetry Collector to AKS:

  If you're using Helm, there are Helm charts available for the OpenTelemetry Collector. Modify the values to suit your configuration and deploy.

#### 3. Instrument Your Spring Boot Application:

- As previously described, download and use the OpenTelemetry Java Agent with your application.

- Set the endpoint for the telemetry data to your collector service within AKS:

  ```bash
  -Dotel.exporter.otlp.endpoint=http://otel-collector-service:4317
  ```

#### 4. Deploy Your Instrumented Application to AKS:

Ensure your Kubernetes deployment YAML for your application includes the necessary configurations and environment variables. It should reference the Java Agent and OpenTelemetry configurations.

#### 5. Test and Monitor:

- After deploying, interact with your application to generate some telemetry data.

- Go to Azure Portal > Application Insights > Monitor > Logs. Check if telemetry data is being received.

- You should see traces, metrics, and other telemetry data in Application Insights.
